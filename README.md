# XSEDE-SWC-Workshop

We plan to run a half-day workshop that introduces XSEDE16 attendees to Software and 
Data Carpentry's pedagogy and lessons in an interactive hands on environment where
we let attendees experience small parts of our various lessons. 
The goal of this workshop is not to deliver the full content of a workshop but to introduce
XSEDE attendees and campus champions to the impactful approach to teaching that has made
Software and Data Carpentry so popular around the world.
